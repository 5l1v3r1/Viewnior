Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer
----------------------------------------

About
-----

This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast
and elegant. It's minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for
your images. Among its features are:

* Mouse and keyboard zooming
* Scrolling and dragging
* GIF animation support

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from
the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up
and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed
(GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Variable prefixes
were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.
